                                                  package.json file
                                                  ------------------

- This file is created when we create a new node.js project
- Its used to manage all the project dependencies and script commands
- Its present in the root of the project
- Ways to create: 
  Manual (cumbersome)
  Command: npm init  (answer the series questions)
  Command: npm init -y  (accept all default answers)
- To set a property via cli --> Ex: npm config set init-author-name "Atharva Deshmukh"
  This only updates your global npmrc file 
  now delete package.json file and hit npm init -y

  Property: "main": "index.js", by default, when no other file is there in project and 
            we hit npm init

            when THERE ARE files in the project and we hit npm init, it picks the first file
            sorted alphabetically as the main: property

  USE: we don't push node modules, so when someone else clones the repo, 
       they simply have to run npm init and the dependencies would be picked from the package.json file
