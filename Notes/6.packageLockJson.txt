In package.lock.json
0.13.0 → You want to install exact this version
~0.13.0 → only patch version should be updated
                  Ex: 0.13.2 is OK but 0.14.0 is NOT OK
^0.13.0 → you want to update path or minor releases.
                 Ex: 0.13.1 is OK and 0.14.1 is OK

                                USE CASE:
                                ---------- 
When we install some dependency like express,

package.json becomes
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^5.1.0"
  }

But in package.lock.json, we have,
 "node_modules/express": {
      "version": "5.1.0",    --> FIXED
 }

- package.lock.json is pushed with the project repo
- This 'locked' version helps maintain consistency of dependencies between different installations.
