NodeJS is used to run JS outside the browser.
Creator: Ryan Dahl

Browsers have JS engines to run JS since machines cannot understand JS directly.
Ex: Google Chrome has V8 engine which is written in C++

                                        JavaScript
                                            |
                                           C++
                                            |
                                    Assembly Language

Node.js is an open source JS runtime environment.
Its not a Programming Language
Its not a framewrork.

Node.js is build on Chrome's V8 JS engine


                            Framworks vs Library vs Runtime Envs
                            ------------------------------------


                                            LIBRARY
- A collection of pre-written code (functions, classes, etc.) that you can call when you need it.
- Your control the flow, decide when and how to call the code
- YOU CALL THE CODE.

Ex: Lodash, jQuery

Analogy:
Like ordering ingredients from a store—you still cook the meal.

                                          FRAMEWORK

- A complete structure or skeleton that dictates how your code should be organized. 
  You fill in the pieces.

The framework Controls the flow. It calls your code at specific points. 

Ex: Angular, Next.js, Express.js

Analogy:
Like working with a recipe kit—you follow their steps and only customize certain parts.


                                    RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT

- The engine that runs your code. 
- It provides essential features like memory management, I/O, and system-level APIs.

You don’t write it—you run your code inside it.

Ex: 
Node.js – runtime for running JavaScript outside the browser
JVM – Java Virtual Machine for running Java bytecode
Python interpreter

Analogy:
Like the kitchen where you cook—without it, nothing runs.


                                            How to run node in machine CMD
                                            ------------------------------

- open cmd
- "node" + enter   (to exit, just type ctrl + C  OR process.exit())
- "process" + enter -> provides information about and control over the current Node.js process. 
   It's an essential tool for interacting with the runtime environment

                                            How to run JS file using node
                                            ------------------------------

- open vs code >> create a simple file
- preferably, run the js file from VS code terminal, since we are then already in that directory
- command -> node fileNameWithPath

                                                  package.json file
                                                  ------------------

- This file is created when we create a new node.js project
- Its used to manage all the project dependencies and script commands
- Its present in the root of the project
- Ways to create: 
  Manual (cumbersome)
  Command: npm init  (answer the series questions)
  Command: npm init -y  (accept all default answers)
- To set a property via cli --> Ex: npm config set init-author-name "Atharva Deshmukh"
  This only updates your global npmrc file 
  now delete package.json file and hit npm init -y

  Property: "main": "index.js", by default, when no other file is there in project and 
            we hit npm init

            when THERE ARE files in the project and we hit npm init, it picks the first file
            sorted alphabetically as the main: property

  USE: we don't push node modules, so when someone else clones the repo, 
       they simply have to run npm init and the dependencies would be picked from the package.json file
